                <h5>Pearl of the Indian Ocean</h5>
                <p>Sri Lanka was formerly known as Ceylon to the world. Sri Lanka has a documented history of 3,000 years and a history of pre-historic human settlements found which age upto 125,000 years. The nickname "Pearl of the Indian Ocean" was given to this beautiful country due to it's geographical location and resources which captured interest from all over the world.</p>
                <p>The location and resources of Sri Lanka made it a main part of the ancient Silk Road trade route, which made European countries want to capture this yet to be civilized land. The Portugese first captured it and next came the Dutch and finally the British captured Sri Lanka and made it a part of the British Colony from 1815 to 1948, and in 1948 the national movement for political independence arose and succeeded making Ceylon independent and was later renamed Sri Lanka.</p>
                <p>Today Sri Lanka is home to millions of people of diverse sulture,languages and ethnicities.</p>
