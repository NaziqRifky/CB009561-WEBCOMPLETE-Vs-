                <p>Sigiriya, also called Lion Rock or Lion Mountain, site in central Sri Lanka consisting of the ruins of an ancient stronghold that was built in the late 5th century CE on a remarkable monolithic rock pillar. The rock, which is so steep that its top overhangs the sides, rises to an elevation of 1,144 feet (349 metres) above sea level and is some 600 feet (180 metres) above the surrounding plain <br>The Sinhalese king Kashyapa I (reigned 477-495) built a palace in the shape of a monumental lion on the several acres of ground at the summit, intending it to be a safeguard against his enemies. However, the king was defeated in 495, and the palace fell into ruin. The site soon became a pilgrimage destination, however, and it is now a popular tourist spot. Visitors begin the final ascent to the top through the open paws of the lion, one of the few remaining portions of the palace that are still intact.Also notable are 21 rock paintings of apsaras (celestial singers and dancers).</p>

                <h3>History of Sigiriya</h3>
                <p>Archeological excavations have proven that Sigiriya and its surrounding territories were inhabited for more than 4000 years.Since the 3th century BC Sigiriya was used as a monastery and after eight centuries it was turned into a royal palace.Sigiriya is connected with tragic events in the relationship of the two royal brothers - Prince Kashyapa and Prince Moggallana. King Kashyapa (477-495 AD) illegally took the throne. <br>King Kashyapa used many methods to protect his unique one of a kind kingdom, used wild animals like alligators to protect the surrounding of the rock. He cleared the area and placed the kingdom on top of the Sigiriya stone in order to foresee anything that come from higher ground.  </p>
